Identifying elements by these values (i.e., using IDs, CSS, or xPath locators `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`without`}</em>{` property attributes) makes your tests brittle because they are subject to change any time a new version comes out (or even any time the page is reloaded).`}</p>\n    <p>{`One way to combat this in your own applications is to use dedicated attributes for testing (e.g., `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`test-id`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`dev-id`}</inlineCode>{`). By adding this test-specific attribute to the element, identifying the correct underlying component should be safer.
