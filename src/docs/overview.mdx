# Welcome to V Systems Documentation

<ImageGrid images={[DesignSystemImage]} regularWidth />

V Systems is a blockchain platform that supports the efficient and agile development of decentralized applications.

V Systems is designed for real world use cases and has a set of composable “no code” smart contract templates that cover the vast majority of real-world smart contract use cases without any need for security audits.


## Development

V Systems is a layer-1 public blockchain. Our blockchain development platform makes the technology as user-friendly as possible and greatly ease the burden for developers while exceeding project requirements.
