# Start Building on V Systems Blockchain

V Systems, our approach to application development dictates that developers should not need to write blockchain related code and that smart contracts should not require third-party security audits because our templates have already been audited.

**Our stack has four layers.**

## V Systems Blockchain Knowledge ( Layer-1 )

The V Systems blockchain is the lowest layer of the VSYS stack. It is where primary consensus happens, and it enables the no-code smart contracts, database API, and application specific side chains.

## Database API

For stateful applications, our database API provides a simple, immutable, user funded way of storing application state. Optionally app development teams can choose to fund storage of application state using the database API. It is very flexible.

## No Code Smart Contracts

Our new code smart contracts enable developers to compose powerful functionality without needing to write any smart contract code. The smart contracts should not require third-party security audits because our templates have already been audited.

## No Code Application Sidechains

Currently, we are developing no code application specific side chains. Basically, these combine the no-code smart contracts and the Database API but provide their very own chain. Chains built in this manner will gain access to instant liquidity from a DEX built into the V Systems blockchain.
