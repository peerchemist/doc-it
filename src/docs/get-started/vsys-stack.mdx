# Start Building on V Systems Blockchain

V Systems, our approach to application development dictates that developers should not need to write blockchain related code and that smart contracts should not require third-party security audits because our templates have already been audited.

**Our stack has four layers.**

## V Systems Blockchain Knowledge ( Layer-1 )

The V Systems blockchain is the lowest layer of the VSYS stack. It is where primary consensus happens, and it enables the no-code smart contracts, database API, and application specific side chains.

## Database API

For stateful applications, our database API provides a simple, immutable, user funded way of storing application state. Optionally app development teams can choose to fund storage of application state using the database API. It is very flexible.

## No Code Smart Contracts

Our new code smart contracts enable developers to compose powerful functionality without needing to write any smart contract code. The smart contracts should not require third-party security audits because our templates have already been audited.

## No Code Application Sidechains

Currently, we are developing no code application specific side chains. Basically, these combine the no-code smart contracts and the Database API but provide their very own chain. Chains built in this manner will gain access to instant liquidity from a DEX built into the V Systems blockchain.

# Deciding What Kind of Application to Build

With a new project, the nature of the project often determines which type of application you will need.

## This Project is Replacing an Existing Product

Think about the existing product and how it is used. Gather feedback from existing users and identify areas for improvement.

In general, you will want to at least provide the same type of application as before (unless user feedback suggests that it's not what they need). If you had a web application before, you may want to build a responsive web application this time. Alternatively, you may want to expand on the existing product by offering a mobile application.

## This is a Brand New Product (never before seen)

Think about how the product will be used. Does it offer features that users will want to access on the go? Is it going to be actively used in the field, or is it something users will more likely use from their desk?

In general, you can't go wrong with a web application. If you do your due diligence and design a properly responsive application, you will be able to access it from any connected device, including mobile. If you suspect that the primary mode of interacting with the application will be from a mobile device or if the application needs to work offline, you may want to consider building a dedicated mobile app.
