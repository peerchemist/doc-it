# Token Contract

## Introduction

A **Token Contract** allows users to set up their own tokens on an existing blockchain (e.g. the VSYS chain in our case).

A token is a logical entity on the blockchain. It can represent basically everything that can be stored in a database. Be it a fiat currency like USD, financial assets like a share in a company, or even reputation points of an online platform.

A contract can be thought of as a class in OOP with a bunch of methods. After creating an instance of a contract, functions can be called by sending the function index and arguments(A.K.A Data Stack) to the contract instance.



> If you are new to blockchain, it is highly recommended to quickly go through resources in External Resources of Topics in Blockchain to equip yourself with fundamental knowledge before going further.



There are two types of tokens, namely token <mark>with split</mark> and token <mark>without split</mark> in VSYS. The key difference is **if a token can be further broken down into smaller pieces (and vice versa)**. For example, Bitcoin is token with spilt as it is possible to buy 0.1 Bitcoin while a song is token without split as it makes no sense to buy half a song.

Note that **one instance of Token Contract can define only ONE kind of token for now** though theoretically, it is possible to have multiple kinds of tokens within a contract.


## FAQ

### What is "Unit"?

“Unit” is the granularity of splitting a token. It can be thought of as the smallest denomination available. Let’s take real-world money as an example, if the unit is set to 100, it means the smallest denomination is a cent, and 100 cents is a dollar.

**“Unit” exists to use only integers to represent splitted tokens(e.g. 0.1) as float computation is uncertainty-prone**. If we set unit == 100, 1.5 tokens are actually stored as 150 in the blockchain.


### Difference between the function "Send" & "Transfer"?

**Transfer** is the most powerful function as it allows customising the sender & the recipient at the same time. 

> For contract functions, the contract instance would verify the invoker as per its pre-defined whitelist. Actions defined in the function would be taken only if the invoker is proved valid.

Function <mark>Send</mark>, <mark>Deposit</mark>, and <mark>Withdraw</mark> can be considered as special cases of <mark>Transfer</mark> and is built on top ofTransfer.

- <mark>Send</mark>: The sender is set to the invoker itself. The recipient has to be an account.

- <mark>Deposit</mark>: The sender has to be the invoker itself. The recipient has to be a contract.

- <mark>Withdraw</mark>: The sender has to be a contract. The recipient has to be the invoker itself.

Calling <mark>Transfer</mark> with the sender and the recipient both set to a contract is NOT supported yet but theoretically possible.

> It is discouraged to call function <mark>Transfer</mark> directly in application codes. Call more specialised function like <mark>Send</mark>, <mark>Deposit</mark>, <mark>Withdraw</mark> instead.

## Troubleshooting

### Didn't See Changes via APIs?

- Ensure that you called the right API

- Ensure the transaction is broadcast(i.e. no error in the response dictionary returned by SDK functions. For example, <mark>pv.Account.execute_contract</mark>) 

- Wait for 5s for the transaction to be fully on chain

- Call <mark>/transactions/info/{id}</mark> to see if the transaction’s status is <mark>success</mark>
