# Token Contract Introduction

In a nutshell, Token Contract allows users to set up their own tokens on an existing blockchain(e.g. the VSYS chain in our case).

A token is a logical entity on the blockchain. It can represent basically everything that can be stored in a database. Be it a fiat currency like USD, financial assets like a share in a company, or even reputation points of an online platform.

A contract can be thought of as a class in OOP with a bunch of methods. After creating an instance of a contract, functions can be called by sending the function index and arguments(A.K.A Data Stack) to the contract instance.

There are two types of tokens, namely token <mark>with split</mark> and token <mark>without split</mark> in VSYS. The key difference is **if a token can be further broken down into smaller pieces (and vice versa)**. For example, Bitcoin is token with spilt as it is possible to buy 0.1 Bitcoin while a song is token without split as it makes no sense to buy half a song.

Note that **one instance of Token Contract can define only ONE kind of token for now** though theoretically, it is possible to have multiple kinds of tokens within a contract.
