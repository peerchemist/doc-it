# Payment Channel Contract


## Introduction

Payment Channels have been implemented in a large number of blockchains as a method to increase the scalability of any protocol. By taking a large number of the transactions between two parties off-chain, it can significantly reduce the time and money cost of transactions.

We will be discussing an implementation of a one-way payment channel in VSYS. This document will refer to the paying user as <mark>sender</mark> and the receiving user as <mark>receiver</mark>.


## Implementation

There are a few important variables stored in the contract that defines the behaviour of the channel's functions. The <mark>accumulated load</mark>, <mark>accumulated payment</mark> and the <mark>expiration timestamp</mark>.

- The accumulated load is simply the accumulated amount the sender loads into the channel.

- The accumulated payment is the accumulated amount the receiver has already been paid by the sender.

- The expiration timestamp is the timestamp at which the receiver can no longer collect payments, and the sender can unload the rest of the funds back to themselves.


By ensuring these three key variables can only increase, the payment channel can be kept secure. Since the accumulated load cannot decrease, the recipient can be sure that there is at least a certain amount of funds in the channel without having to check the contract's state values constantly. It isn't possible for the sender to withdraw their funds from the channel until it is closed.

Also, since it isn't possible for the accumulated payment to reduce, it is also possible for the recipient to withdraw any funds they have already collected without waiting for the channel to end.

This implementation allows senders to re-use their existing payment channels even after they have expired, by simply updating the expiration timestamp and loading extra funds into the channel.
