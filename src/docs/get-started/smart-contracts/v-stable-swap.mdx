# V Stable Swap Contract

## Introduction

Creating orders requires the order creator to decide on the price of both sides of the trade and also the fee charged. The fees for the V Stable Swap contract is a set fee and is not calculated as a percentage. The order creator also decides on a maximum and a minimum for each swap, setting the maximum allows the order creator to be sure that they get enough fees for providing liquidity, while setting the minimum ensures the fee does not overwhelm any trades.
