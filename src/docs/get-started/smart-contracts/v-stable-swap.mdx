# V Stable Swap Contract


## Introduction

The V Stable Swap contract acts as an order book system on VSYS. Orders are placed into the smart contract and acts as a liquidity pool for both sides of the swap. Traders are free to take either side of the trade as long as the pool has sufficient liquidity. The V Stable Swap contract can accept any type of token in the VSYS blockchain, including option tokens created through the V Option Contract.


## Implementation

Creating orders requires the order creator to decide on the price of both sides of the trade and also the fee charged. The fees for the V Stable Swap contract is a set fee and is not calculated as a percentage. The order creator also decides on a maximum and a minimum for each swap, setting the maximum allows the order creator to be sure that they get enough fees for providing liquidity, while setting the minimum ensures the fee does not overwhelm any trades.
