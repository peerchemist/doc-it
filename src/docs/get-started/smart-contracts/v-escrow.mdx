# V Escrow Contract


## Introduction

The V Escrow contract allows two parties to do transactions with one another if they have mutual trust in a third party. It is expected that the third party will be a large trusted entity that receives fees for facilitating transactions between parties.

A simple example would be the delivery of a physical object where the recipient pays using cryptocurrencies. Once the delivery has been made, the trusted third party can review the evidence of the shipping/mailing and distribute the funds accordingly.


## Implementation

The Judge should register the V Escrow Contract, and decides the token the funds will be paid in, and how long the recipient and judge are allowed to take for their actions.

The Payer will create the order and decides the amount to pay the recipient, the fee that the judge receives, and also the penalties for all the parties if they do not perform their actions within the allocated time.
