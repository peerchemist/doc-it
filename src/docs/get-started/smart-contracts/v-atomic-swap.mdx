# V Atomic Swap Contract


## Introduction

The Atomic Swap is a method of swapping coins or tokens in a secure manner that requires no trusted party to hold custody of the coins. When swapping coins, the two untrusted party runs into a problem, whoever gets sent the coins first can simply abandon the deal and run off with the coins.

The Atomic Swap solves this issue by using the properties of a hash function, that the hash function is deterministic (the same input gives the same output), and that it cannot be reversed (the input cannot be determined from the output).


## Example

You will understand what atomic swap contract does in v.systems with the following example.

Let’s take Alice and Bob as an example. Alice wants to exchange 1 BTC for 3 ETH with Bob. For safety reasons, they use the atomic swap contract.

First, Alice will create a secret A and hash it, get Hash(secret A). Since hash value is infeasible to reverse, no one should be able to get Secret A from Hash(Secret A).

Alice then creates an Atomic swap contract Contract A, and then deposit 1 BTC into the contract. There will be two different situations:

1. If Alice broadcasts secret A before timestamp B, Contract A will transfer 1 BTC to Bob’s address.

2. If nothing is done before timestamp A, 1 BTC will return to Alice’s address.

Then Bob creates an Atomic Swap contract Contract B and then deposit 3 ETH into the contract. There will be two different situations:

1. If Alice has broadcasted secret A before timestamp B, Contract B can get secret A to transfer 3 ETH to Alice’s address.

2. If nothing is done before timestamp B, 3 ETH will return to Bob’s address.

Remember that timestamp B must be earlier than timestamp A, otherwise, Alice may withdraw 1 BTC and receive Bob’s 3 ETH.


## Implementation

The VSYS Atomic Swap contract can store a single type of Token. To swap between different Tokens, two separate contracts are necessary. Users are required to deposit Tokens into the contract before they are able to lock it.

The **lock** function itself is fairly simplistic, the input should be the hash of some secret together with the determined recipient and an expiration timestamp. To unlock the lock, the recipient simply needs to call the **SolvePuzzle** function with the transaction id of the lock together with the secret.

The contract will check that the hash of the secret matches the puzzle in the lock. If it matches, the contract will transfer ownership of the locked coins or tokens to the recipient. Note, however, that while the funds change ownership, they stay within the contract, so the wallet's balance won't change until the recipient withdraws the funds from the contract.
