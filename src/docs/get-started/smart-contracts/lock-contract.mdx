# Lock Contract


## Introduction

Lock contracts allow users to lock a specific token in the contract for some period of time. This allows users to guarantee they have a certain amount of funds upon lock expiration. This may be helpful in implementing some kinds of staking interactions with users of a VSYS token for instance.


## Implementation

The lock contract is a very simple contract that is able to store a selected token. It allows anyone to execute this contract and lock their funds into it for some period of time. It is not necessary to open multiple lock contracts for different people to lock their coins of tokens.


## Tutorial

For the tutorials, you can check the documentations for the token contracts of SDKs.
