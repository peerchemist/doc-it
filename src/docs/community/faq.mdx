# Frequently Asked Questions

We strive to provide as much information as possible about Brightlayer UI in our documentation as possible. However, we can't always cover everything. Below are some common questions that people have asked about the platform. Please check to see if your question has been answered below before contacting us directly.

## General

<div>
<FAQExpander question={`Can you provide our team with an overview of Brightlayer UI?`}>

Yes. If you would like to meet with our team to go over the basics (whats and whys) of Brightlayer UI and go through everything that we have to offer, please get in touch with us to set up a time.

</FAQExpander>

<FAQExpander question={`What is your release schedule?`}>

Brightlayer UI operates on a continuous delivery model — we release new resources as soon as they are available. Our work is planned on a quarterly basis and towards the end of each quarter we hold a release announcement event where we go over all of the updates to the platform that were made during that quarter and answer questions from the community. If you would like to attend these announcements, please contact us and we will add you to our mailing list. You can track our progress for the current quarter on our [Roadmap](/roadmap) page, which is updated every two weeks.

## Developers

<div>
<FAQExpander question={`How do I start a project?`}>

If you are starting a new project, we highly recommend using the [Brightlayer UI CLI](/development/cli) to start your project. This will automatically integrate all of the necessary Brightlayer UI resources as well as give you several templates to choose from for starting your project. If you need to integrate Brightlayer UI into an existing project, we have comprehensive Getting Started guides for [Web](/development/frameworks-web/intro) and [Mobile](/development/frameworks-mobile/intro) projects that walk you through the steps necessary to add Brightlayer UI to your project, including adding themes, components libraries, etc.

<FAQExpander question={`Do you support VueJS, WPF, Flutter, or other frameworks?`}>

At this time, Brightlayer UI only supports Angular or React for web projects and Ionic (with Angular) or React Native for mobile applications. While we would love to be able to support all of the other great frameworks that are out there, the Brightlayer UI team does not currently have the resources to effectively support them all. One of the primary goals of Brightlayer UI is to maximize re-usability and code-sharing between projects / teams — supporting every possible framework goes against this principle. We've tried to support enough frameworks to give teams flexibility in their choice while also ensuring that we can continue to provide meaningful content on an ongoing basis.

<FAQExpander question={`Can the Brightlayer UI team build my application?`}>

The Brightlayer UI team is not currently staffed for doing project development for product teams. We are available to support your development team with integrating and using the Brightlayer UI resources in your project, but you will need to build your own development team to create your application.

</FAQExpander>

<FAQExpander question={`Do you have icons for _____?`}>

With Brightlayer UI, you have access to all of the Material Design icons as well as additional icons that have been designed specifically for Brightlayer UI applications. These can all be browsed on our [Iconography](/style/iconography) page. Clicking on an icon will show information about the icon including usage instructions in our supported frameworks as well as buttons to download icons individually. If you need an icon that is not currently available, contact us and we will work with you on a solution.

</FAQExpander>

<FAQExpander question={`How do I build my own theme?`}>

Most applications should stick to using the default Brightlayer UI themes. However, in some cases you may need to develop your own theme, such as for products that are sold under a different brand or are white-labeled for other companies. In this case, you should refer to the theming instructions for your selected framework ([Angular](https://v7.material.angular.io/guide/theming), [React](https://mui.com/customization/theming/), [React Native](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html)). You may wish to start with the default Brightlayer UI themes and extend only the pieces that need to change for your project.

</FAQExpander>

<FAQExpander question={`Can I use other charting solutions (e.g., D3) with Brightlayer UI?`}>

Currently, Brightlayer UI recommends using [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com) for your charting needs. If you prefer an open-source charting alternative, Brightlayer UI also offers resources for working with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/). You can read more about this on our [Visualizations](/patterns/visualizations) page. You may use other charting solutions in your application if there is a genuine business need, but keep in mind that this may compromise the consistency and reusability of your solution when compared to other projects.

</FAQExpander>

<FAQExpander question={`What if I need to build a desktop app?`}>

If you need to build a standalone desktop application, we recommend using a tool like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). This will allow you to build the application using one of Brightlayer UI's supported web technologies while still being able to package the application for installation onto a desktop.
